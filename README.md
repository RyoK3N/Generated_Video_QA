This project is designed to evaluate the quality of AI-generated videos by comparing them with a ground truth video. It computes various metrics such as MSE (Mean Squared Error), PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio), SSIM (Structural Similarity Index), and face landmark differences using AWS Rekognition. The results are logged and can be visualized using the provided visualize.py script.
